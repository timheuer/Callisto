# Contributing

Callisto is obviously an Open Source project.  We welcome contributions.  Please read the guidelines below before forking/contributing.

## Workflow

* We use the **dev** branch for active development. All pull requests should be made to this branch.
* The master branch is only updated via pull requests from the dev branch.

## Code Style

* Indent with spaces (4) instead of tabs.
* Prefix private instance field names with an underscore and be camel-cased. The `this` keyword should be avoided.
* Use the `var` keyword unless the inferred type is not obvious.
* Use the C# type aliases for types that have them (ex. `int` instead of `Int32`).
* Use meaningful names (no hungarian notation).
